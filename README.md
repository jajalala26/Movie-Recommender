This repository contains solutions to two distinct problems that explore different representations of text for a common task.

Problem 1: Implements a factorization model with learned vector embeddings for each item. This approach focuses on leveraging embeddings to capture and represent text information effectively.

Problem 2: An open-ended challenge where any method, including advanced or unconventional approaches, is allowed. The goal is to explore a wide variety of techniques to solve the task with a flexible, innovative approach.
